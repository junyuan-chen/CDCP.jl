	solve!((sub, sup, aux); scdca::Bool, obj, [D_j_obj; containers])

Solve in-place a combinatorial discrete choice problem with SCD-C from above if `scdca` is `true` (otherwise, from below). The solver uses the preallocated Boolean vectors `(sub, sup, aux)` as well as the objective function `obj(J)`. The objective function `obj` must accept as argument a Boolean vector with length corresponding to the number of items in the problem.

The solver can optionally take `D_j_obj(j, J)`, a user-supplied marginal value function; otherwise it will construct one automatically given `π`. It may also optionally take preallocated `containers = (working, converged)`, where `working` and `converged` are both `Vectors` with element type matching `(sub, sup, aux)`. These are used for the branching step and will be automatically allocated if not supplied.
